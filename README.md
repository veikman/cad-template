# A template for computer-aided design

This project installs as a plug-in to the Leiningen project management system.
It is a template for making new CAD projects in Matthew Farrell’s
[`scad-clj`](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj), a Clojure wrapper for
OpenSCAD.

## Usage

In this directory, run `lein install` to make Leiningen aware of this template.

Where you want to start a new project, run `lein new cad your-project-name`.
Consult `lein new --help` for options.

Your new project will have its own [README.md](resources/new/cad/README.md)
with further instructions.
